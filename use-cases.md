    <h2>Target MTM program enrollees</h2>
    <p class="usa-intro text-balance measure-4">Identify Medication Therapy Management enrollees by using data for a more thorough search capability.</p>
    <p>AB2D data can help you identify beneficiaries who may be eligible for your Part D [Medication Therapy Management (MTM)M](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coverage/prescription-drug-coverage-contracting/medication-therapy-management) programs. You can use AB2D data to help identify enrollees who meet the MTM targeting criteria, like those with certain chronic diseases or diagnoses.</p>

    <h2>Enhance MTM services</h2>
    <p class="usa-intro text-balance measure-4">Leverage insights from enrollee medical histories for more effective services.</p>
    <p>Plan sponsors can use AB2D data to get a holistic overview of enrollees' health histories. This allows for more informed discussions between the MTM provider and enrollee during comprehensive or targeted medication reviews:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Promote safe and effective medication use.</li>
      <li>Prevent potential gaps in medication therapies.</li>
      <li>Identify appropriate medication alternatives.</li>
      <li>Reduce adverse drug events or interactions.</li>
      <li>Enhance coordination of care across providers and pharmacists.</li>
      <li>Allocate resources efficiently to save on costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Boost health outcomes</h2>
    <p class="usa-intro text-balance measure-4">Enhance MTM enrollee health and program results by improving medication use and adherence.</p>
    <p>Part D [Star Ratings](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/health-drug-plans/part-c-d-performance-data) evaluate the quality of services received by beneficiaries in your plan. CMS offers incentives to Prescription Drug Plan sponsors (PDPs) with high Star Ratings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CMS highlights contracts with an overall rating of 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Beneficiaries may enroll in a 5-Star PDP, MA-PD, or MA-only plan through a Special Election Period.</li>
      <li>PDPs with 5-star plans may market year-round.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Medication adherence is one of the quality measures used to rate PDPs. AB2D data can address medication adherence, as well as statin use in persons with diabetes or other medication therapy problems, by proactively identifying MTM enrollees who may benefit from targeted intervention. As a result, this may help improve their health, the effectiveness of your programs, and your Star Ratings.</p>

    <h2>Prevent fraud, waste, and abuse</h2>
    <p class="usa-intro text-balance measure-4">Identify suspicious activity from providers or suppliers through access to mass data.</p>
    <p>Find suspicious patterns from providers or suppliers to reduce fraud and financial losses. By adding AB2Dâ€™s [Bulk Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">FHIR</a> data to your existing data streams, you can conduct trend analysis and search mass enrollee data to quickly identify:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>duplicate billing</li>
      <li>services misaligned with enrollee histories</li>
      <li>opioid overutilization</li>

Permitted uses include fraud, waste, and abuse detection from providers and suppliers only.
