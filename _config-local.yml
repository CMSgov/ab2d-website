# To speed up local development, this additional config will
# prevent Jekyll from copying icons unless specified (which
# should match what's listed in .gitignore).
#
# Add this flag to `bundle exec jekyll serve`:
# --config _config.yml,_config-local.yml
#
# This is only necessary if USWDS has been compiled locally. It prevents
# each build from copying 2K+ assets to _site. Otherwise (as with CI/CD)
# the site will build only from the committed icons.
#
# TODO: Confirm Jekyll 4 requirement (`include` is a Jekyll 4 config option).
# Jekyll 3 will not copy icons with this config.
